# 344-Final-Program
# First time using Python
# By Joshua Meritt

This program is based off of the programs; Drone, Parsing-Tree, Simplify, and Turing-Machine and assumes all are in a folder called '344'
The program goes through all of the programs and counts the number of lines for each program and 
determines all the words used in program, getting rid of the duplicates and symbols. After that, it creates a JSON file based off of the
previous data gathered and creates a HTML file based off the JSON file. It then zips the entire directory and asks for an email to send 
the zipped file to. It then sends the email with the attachment and then the html can be opened and it contains an overview of the whole 
project with links to each indivual program which then contains a link to the source code for each program. 
Note that this program only works on my specific computer due to the hard coding of file paths but could easily be adjusted for others.
